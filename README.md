# Mini-Compiler

### A mini compiler that can support binary arithmetic operators and a few built-in Python functions.

## Task
Implemented the binary arithmetic operators of +, -, and *, also adding built-in Python functions of min, max, print, abs, and pow.

### Run Locally
* Run this Command: git clone https://github.com/b05702057/Mini-Compiler.git
* Run this Command: npm install
* Run this Command: npm test
* Run this Command: npm run build-web
* Open the file build/index.html in a browser

### Note
* The detailed tasks are recorded here: https://ucsd-cse231-s22.github.io/week/week1/#assignment-1.
* Different behaviors from this compiler and Python:
  1. When my PA faces a "/" operator, it would throw an error of "PARSE ERROR: unknown binary operator". 
  2. When my PA faces the ceiling function, it would throw the error "PARSE ERROR: unknown builtin1".
  3. When my PA faces the floor function, it would throw the error "PARSE ERROR: unknown builtin1".
